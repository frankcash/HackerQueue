[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frankcash/HackerQueue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frankcash/HackerQueue)

Your favorite tech sites compiled down to topics you find interesting.

Scrapes [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), and [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming) and then compiles them into a searchable and viewable source.

F.A.Q.
===

Q. Why did we create this?

A. HackerQueue was created because it gets annoying to go to more than one site for news, especially when you like to read a lot.

Q. Why does HackerQueue only display these three sites?

A. HackerQueue is currently purposed for news about Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Networking, and their cultures.  The direction I wish for it to take may change in the future though.

Q. Will HackerQueue ever support posts?

A. If enough users are accumulated.

Q. What if I want more sites to be added?

A. Please create an issue report and mark it as an enhancement.  I will look into it.  If the site is related to Comp Sci/Comp Eng/ Networking or their cultures I will probably add it when I get free time.

Q. What is the purpose of the Database?

A. This is purely experimental right now, you could possible run analytics queries on it if you want.
