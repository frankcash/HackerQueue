[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/frankcash/HackerQueue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/frankcash/HackerQueue)

Your favorite tech sites compiled down to topics you find interesting.

Scrapes [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), and [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming) and then compiles them into a searchable and viewable source.

F.A.Q.
===

Q. Why did we create this?

A. HackerQueue was created because it gets annoying to go to more than one site for news, especially when you like to read a lot.

Q. Why does HackerQueue only display these three sites?

A. HackerQueue is currently purposed for news about Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Networking, and their cultures.  The direction I wish for it to take may change in the future though.

Q. Will HackerQueue ever support posts?

A. If enough users are accumulated.

Q. What if I want more sites to be added?

A. Please create an issue report and mark it as an enhancement.  I will look into it.  If the site is related to Comp Sci/Comp Eng/ Networking or their cultures I will probably add it when I get free time.

Q. What is the purpose of the Database?

A. This is purely experimental right now, you could possible run analytics queries on it if you want.

## Database Config
You'll need to run a local instance of PostgreSQL server.
Windows users can follow this guide - http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/
1. Create the table(s) defined in `db/schema/`.
    1. Copy the command and run it in your PostgreSQL server (possible using psql shell, comes with your installation)
2. Make sure you have an env variable `DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>`.  If using docker-compose don't worry about the port.


## To Run Locally
1. Clone the project
2. Install the dependencies 
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```
3. Make sure the PostgreSQL server is configured properly
    1. Has a table as defined in `db/schema/`
    2. You have the following environment variable configured -
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
    ```
3. Make sure the PostgreSQL server is running and listening on the port specified.
4. Run HackerQueue
    ```
    $ node app.js
    ```


## To run in Docker
